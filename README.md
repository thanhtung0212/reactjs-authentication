# Authentication System

This project is an authentication system that provides the following features:

## Login

The login feature allows users to authenticate themselves by providing their credentials. Once authenticated, users can access protected resources within the system.

To implement the login feature, you can use a combination of a username/email and password for authentication. You may also consider incorporating additional security measures such as two-factor authentication or password hashing.

## Signup

The signup feature enables new users to create an account within the system. Users can provide their personal information and choose a unique username and password.

When implementing the signup feature, make sure to validate user input, enforce password complexity requirements, and handle any potential errors or exceptions that may occur during the signup process.

## Session Management

The session management feature ensures that users remain authenticated across multiple requests or sessions. This allows users to access protected resources without having to re-authenticate for each request.

To handle session management, you can use techniques such as session tokens, cookies, or JSON Web Tokens (JWT). It's important to securely store and manage session data to prevent unauthorized access or session hijacking.
